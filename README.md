Welcome to my *definitely*, well now I cant say it, anywho welcome to my NOT fully made by myself website, I know until now the website looks pretty plain but will add some more changes to the website in the future,
this about is the Official "Al-Mutafawakeen Public Schools Basra" Website for public use ONLY if you are a part of the school such as a student or a teacher etc..., this website holds the student database
for The Second Al-Mutafawakeen Public School, in this website if you are a teacher you can login and have admin access to students, you can also check their grades, give them warnings, notices and etc...,
trust will add more in the future.
